Hi, I’m [AHMAD MUHAMMAD], Fellow ID [FE/23/83935309].

Today, I’m excited to present my AI-powered Job Matcher project for the 3MTT Showcase.

The problem is simple: job seekers often struggle to find roles that truly match their skills and experiences.

My solution uses AI — specifically, a model from the sentence-transformers library — to understand the meaning behind a user’s bio or skill set and compare it with job descriptions.

Let me show you how it works.

Here, I input a sample bio: "I am a Python developer with experience in data analysis and machine learning."

The AI processes this bio and compares it with several job descriptions like Data Scientist, Web Developer, and AI Engineer.

It calculates similarity scores and finds the best job fit.

As you can see, the AI matched the bio with the "Data Scientist" role, with a similarity score of 0.76.

This demonstrates how AI can make job searching smarter by understanding the context, not just keywords.

You can run this project entirely on your phone using Google Colab or Pydroid 3.

Thank you for watching, and don’t forget to check out my code on GitHub: [https://github.com/PrnxAhmad/JobMatcher.git].
